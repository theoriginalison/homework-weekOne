## Approach

I looked at the assignment immediately after class on Saturday, so I would have the week to wrap my head around everything. I began by reading the README file, then started with the easiest elements, then would come back to the assignment every few days (so I could start to see what I wasn't seeing, and could apply what I just learned). I also scheduled a tutoring session (and set up recurring sessions) for Friday, and set the goal of finishing my homework before the tutoring seession to the best of my ability, so I could go over it with my tutor. This worked out really well. Then, Tom posted info on README files, and I added what you're reading rn!

## Changes

- Fixed broken link
- Added alt attributes that made sense
- Added a title element that made sense
- Changed <div> where they made sense for semantic HTML. Added <nav>, <main>, and <aside>. I also added <section> within <main> and <aside>. Each of these changed elements have a comment before them.
- Long class and ID tags were abbreviated
- In CSS specifically, I:
  - Grouped together classes with the same formatting
  - Reordered the whole sheet so it lined up with HTML, sequentially
  - Labeled each section with a comment

## Discoveries

- A README file is a whole other endeavor, kind of like a lab report. It would be helpful to start this at the beginning, so I can track my progress and thoughts.
- Tutoring is very helpful.
